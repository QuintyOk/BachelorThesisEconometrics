The code for the replication and extension part of my bachelor thesis


Replication:
I have attached the codes for the boston housing dataset. The code for the other datasets is exactly the same but with different variable names and different data, so if you wish to change the dataset this should be easy to implement.

Extension:
I have also attached the codes for my extension for both the NHANES dataset and boston housing dataset. The removed several columns of the NHANES dataset beforehand in excel (they had a lot of NAs), and have attached this final cleaned excel sheet in this github as well.

For both the extension and replication, I have attached the code used to make the graphs too.
